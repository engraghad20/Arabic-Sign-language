Hash Plus Bootcamp Project â€“ Arabic Sign Language Recognition for the Deaf and Mute

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal:
This project was designed to develop an AI model to recognize Arabic letters in sign language, to help the deaf and mute communicate more easily and effectively.

Project Idea

I started by experimenting with recognizing all 28 Arabic letters, collecting 252 images for all the letters.
However, I faced a major challenge:

Lack of data for each letter led to low model accuracy and its inability to correctly recognize the images.

To overcome this problem, I focused on five main letters [Ø£, Ø¨, Øª, Ø«, Ø¬], providing 50 clear images per letter.
âœ… Result: The modelâ€™s ability to recognize the letters improved significantly and became much more accurate.


Challenges I Faced
1. Lack of data: The initial images for all letters were not sufficient for effective model training.
2. Image variety: Differences in angles, lighting, and backgrounds affected recognition performance.
3. Data preparation: It was necessary to carefully prepare the images and create accurate label files to avoid training errors.


Current Results
The model is capable of recognizing 5 main letters with good accuracy.

ðŸ’¡ Upgradeable: Work is ongoing to expand the model to cover all 28 Arabic letters, increasing the dataset size and improving accuracy.
